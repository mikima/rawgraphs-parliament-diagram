# RAWGraphs Parliament Diagram

This chart has been developed using the "chart template" provided by RAWGraphs.

The chart is meant to be an example for the upcoming workshop on Custom Charts.

It is not meant to be used, several issues and errors are still in the chart.


For more detailed instructions on building custom charts, read the following documentation:

* [Create your first chart](docs/add-a-new-chart.md)
* [Good practices and conventions](docs/good-practices.md)
* [RAWgraphs core library technical documentation](https://rawgraphs.github.io/rawgraphs-core/docs/)
